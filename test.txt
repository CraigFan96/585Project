You like the way that sounds?

Little Jimmy Jackson is jackin' up his Bronco
He's gonna lay a little rubber later on at the truck pull
And all the girls are getting pretty sprayin' on the White Rain
Yeah they're gonna get a-rowdy tonight down at the football game
Yeah

We let it rip when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
It gets wild yeah but that's the way we get down
In a hick town

Well you can see the neighbors buttcrack nailing on his shingles
And his woman's smokin' Pall Malls watchin' Laura Ingalls
And Granny's getting' lit she's headin' out to bingo
Yeah my buddies and me are goin' muddin' down on Blue Hole Road
You know, you know?

We let it rip when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
It gets wild yeah but that's the way we get down
In a hick town

We hear folks in the city party in martini bars
And they like to show off in their fancy foreign cars
Out here in the boondocks we buy beer at Amoco
And crank our Kraco speakers with that country radio

We let it rip when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
It gets wild yeah but that's the way we get down
Oh oh we let it rip when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
It's buck wild yeah but that's the way we get down
In a hick town
In a hick town
It's the way we get down
In a hick town
Yeah in a hick town

Oh we ain't finished yet
We got your country boys and your redneck girls
It's the party heard 'round the world
Right here in hick town
Yeah in hick town
The whole town's gettin' down

He gets up before the dawn
Packs a lunch an' a thermos full o' coffee
It's another day in the dusty haze
Those burnin' rays are wearin' down his body
The diesel's worth the price of gold
It's the cheapest grain he's ever sold
But he's still holdin' on

He just takes the tractor another round
An' pulls the plow across the ground
And sends up another prayer
He says: "Lord, I never complain, I never ask 'Why?'
Please don't let my dreams run dry
Underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky"

That hail storm back in '83
Sure did take a toll on his family
But he stayed strong and carried on
Just like his Dad and Granddad did before him
On his knees every night
He prays: "Please let my crops and children grow"
'Cause that's all he's ever known

He just takes the tractor another round
An' pulls the plow across the ground
And sends up another prayer
He says: "Lord, I never complain, I never ask 'Why?'
Please don't let my dreams run dry
Underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky"

An' he takes the tractor another round (Another round)
Another round (Another round)
Another round
An' he takes the tractor another round, another round
He says: "I never complain, I never ask 'Why?'
Please don't let my dreams run dry
Underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky
Underneath this Amarillo Sky"

I got smoke in my hair
My clothes thrown everywhere
Woke up in my rockin' chair
Holdin' a beer in my hand
Sportin' a neon tan

My stereo cranked up
I can't find my truck
How'd I get home from the club
Don't have a clue what went down
So I started callin' around

And all my friends say
I started shootin' doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him

You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raisin' some cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Gettin' over you comeback kid
Hey I musta did
What all my friends say
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I found my billfold
I cried oh no, no
Good time Charlie got me
Now I'm broke
But it was worth actin' like a fool
Yeah, girl, I must really showed you

'Cause all my friends say
I started shootin' doubles when you walk in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seein' you with him

You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raisin' some cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Gettin' over you comeback kid
Hey I musta did
What all my friends say
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I was Elvis rockin'
On the bar
Workin' the crowd
Pourin' out my heart


And all my friends say
I started shootin' doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him

You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raisin' some cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Gettin' over you comeback kid
Hey I musta did
What all my
(All my)
All my friends say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's what all my friends say
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's what all my friends say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's what all my friends say

Luke Bryan - Baby's on the Way

I ain't been doin' to right
Since I met her last night
Some kinda burnin' breakfast lost at work state of mind.
We're MEETING here because
She mentioned that she loves
This kinda sushi, veggie, raw and edgy natural stuff.
I'm feelin' out of place, but baby's on the way.

I'm just boots in a rusty Chevy
My hands are sweatin' heavy
Somethin' she's got got me feelin' like this
All I gotta do is play it cool
And end the night with a kiss.
Hey, hey. Baby's on the way.

Ain't gonna try those lines
Been used so many times
Like "When you fell from heaven, did it hurt and did you cry?"
I'm just gonna wear this smile
Sit back and talk a while.
Pull a few questions from my "Get to know Her Better" file.
Yeah, it's a real good day, cause baby's on the way.

I'm just boots in a rusty Chevy
My hands are sweatin' heavy
Somethin' she got, got me feelin' like this.
All I gotta do is play it cool
And end the night with a kiss.
Hey, hey. Baby's on the way.

Just a simple case of can't wait
Gonna be great to see her again.
Gonna be tough to hide what's inside
And in my eyes when she walks in.

I'm just boots in a rusty Chevy
My hands are sweatin' heavy
Somethin' she got got me feelin' like this
All I gotta do is play it cool
And end the night with a kiss.
Hey, hey. Baby's on the way.

Hey, hey. Baby's on the way.
