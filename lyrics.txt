We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore 
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore 
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
I just heard you found the one you've been looking 
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily 
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holding onto you so tight 
The way I did before 
I overdosed 
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain 
Oh, it's such a shame 
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore 
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore 
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
I just hope you're lying next to somebody 
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong 
Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holding onto you so tight the way I did before 
I overdosed 
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain 
Oh, it's such a shame 
That we don't talk anymore (We don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore (We don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore (We don't, we don't)
What was all of it for? (We don't, we don't)
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
Like we used to do
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right 
The way I did before 
I overdosed 
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain 
Oh, it's such a shame 
That we don't talk anymore (We don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore (We don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore (We don't, we don't)
What was all of it for? (We don't, we don't)
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't talk anymore, oh, oh
(What kind of dress you're wearing tonight)
(If he's holding onto you so tight)
The way I did before 
We don't talk anymore, oh, woah
(Should've known your love was a game)
(Now I can't get you out of my brain)
Ooh, it's such a shame 
That we don't talk anymore
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven sin
Saw you there and I thought 
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake 
Loveâ€™s a game, want to play?
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine 
Ain't it funny, rumors, lie
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends 
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend 
So it's gonna be forever 
Or it's gonna go down in flames 
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane 
'Cause you know I love the players 
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless 
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless 
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane 
But I've got a blank space baby
And I'll write your name
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king baby I'm your Queen 
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month 
Wait the worst is yet to come, oh no
Screaming, crying, perfect storm
I can make all the tables turn
Rose gardens filled with thorns 
Keep you second guessing like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy 
But you'll come back each time you leave 
'Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream 
So it's gonna be forever 
Or it's gonna go down in flames 
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane 
'Cause you know I love the players 
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless 
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless 
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)
But I've got a blank space baby
And I'll write your name
Boys only want love if it's torture 
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture 
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya
So it's gonna be forever 
Or it's gonna go down in flames 
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane 
'Cause you know I love the players 
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless 
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless 
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane 
But I've got a blank space baby
And I'll write your name
Karma police
Arrest this man
He talks in maths
He buzzes like a fridge
He's like a detuned radio
Karma police
Arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo
Is making me feel ill
And we have crashed her party
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us
Karma police
I've given all I can
It's not enough
I've given all I can
But we're still on the payroll
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
And everything is going to the beat
And everything is going to the beat
And everything is going
And you said, it was like fire around the brim
Burning solid, burning thin the burning rim
Like stars burning holes right through the dark
Flicking fire like saltwater into my eyes
You were one inch from the edge of this bed
I dragged you back a sleepyhead, sleepyhead
They couldn't think of something to say the day you burst
With all their lions, with all their might and all their thirst
They crowd your bedroom like some thoughts wearing thin
Against the walls, against your rules, against your skin
My beard grew down to the floor and out through the doors
Of your eyes, begonia skies like a sleepyhead, sleepyhead
Far away
The ship is taking me far away
Far away from the memories
Of the people who care if I live or die
The starlight
I will be chasing a starlight
Until the end of my life
I don't know if it's worth it anymore
Hold you in my arms
I just wanted to hold
You in my arms
My life
You electrify my life
Let's conspire to ignite
All the souls that would die just to feel alive
Now I'll never let you go
If you promised not to fade away
Never fade away
Our hopes and expectations
Black holes and revelations
Our hopes and expectations
Black holes and revelations
Hold you in my arms
I just wanted to hold
You in my arms
Far away
The ship is taking me far away
Far away from the memories
Of the people who care if I live or die
And I'll never let you go
If you promise not to fade away
Never fade away
Our hopes and expectations
Black holes and revelations
Our hopes and expectations
Black holes and revelations
Hold you in my arms
I just wanted to hold
You in my arms
I just wanted to hold
