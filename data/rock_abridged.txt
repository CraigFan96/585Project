[Voice Talking:] But anyway I... I... I like to value my
Relationship with women. You know sometimes I get so
Deeply involved I just, I just have to feel like
Oral sex would complete our relationship

Sometimes goin' from behind (from behind)
Slowly strokin, no jokin

And then wash it down with a shot of whiskey

I remember when I spent the night at Sally's house
Woke up with Cotton Mouth
Couldn't speak
My tongue was weak
From Yo-Da-Lin In The Valley
Oh I love them mountain thighs
And a pizza pie before my eyes
But before I taste them juices
I make sure this Sally douches
But she's not the only one

But yo you know that I'm most happy

Whisper In their ear and make it clear

'Cause I'm not gonna say I love you when your sitting upon my face
Oh yes It's warm and wet
In the valley you bet (bet)
And get this, one girl I yodled on
Had a bush thicker than the amazon
Forest

Came out with hair on my toungue
But still I got the job done

Do what you have to
I do what I had to
To break through a pick a style that sticks like glue
And as I rank I wanna thank no one
'Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done
You helped me around
My parents put me down
I never skipped town
I stood my ground
We kept showin up
Drinkin' and throwin' up
Rap was my life
As I was growin' up
Actin' a fool in school no one topped us
Smart ass in class at times abnoxious
Drivin' a bronco
Runnin' my own show
And pullin the look a like Marilyn Monroe hoes
And me and Bo got together
Made sense
Spent many nights in Mt. Clemens basements
I scratched records and performed a few tricks
KDC mix let the Black man talk shit
Pumpin the new sounds town to town
Who holds it down like Bad Leroy Brown
Now I won't stop cause yo I'm Kid Rock
The Genuine Article

They don't want me
'Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done

F-F-Fames a costin the price ain't nice
It's like the roll of the dice
For a whole new life
But don't get my song wrong
I enjoy it alot
Walkin' around like a big shot
'Cause I'm Kid Rock
Smooth as an ice cube
Cool as an igloo
And more complex, than a rubix cube
A healthy wealthy young one with a quick tongue
Smart from the start and from the heart my rhymes run
And as I incline through time to get mine
I try not to slide, but walk a straight line
Though it's hard when the climb gets steep
The one who finds is the one who seeks
So I sought and fought
And alot I got taught
And although I left those who stole got caught
Many shows I rocked
Many suckers I laughed at
And those who snapped back usually got slapped
The cat if I was strap
'Cause I was a sun of a gun
Livin' life on the run
Now I pleaded 18 and outdone by none
Bold, Young, Handsome, Bad like Bronson
Pumpin the new sounds town to town
And when in motown I cool out in Greektown
On the upside with nothin' too high
The Genuine Article

They don't want me
'Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done
Chuck nice break that beat down
Uh huh... Uh huh... Uh huh
KDC... huh

Six Generations of rap and I'm first
Ready to burst, the style is rehearsed
I worked and worked and worked and I worked
When many thought I was just gettin' jerked
Used, abused, but I paid my dues
And now no one out there could fill my shoes
And my pants and do this dance
This shit didn't happen by chance
It went slow not quick, but now I'm your pick
Ain't that a trip when I started from zip
And now up and up and up I won't stop
The flop just pop the flat top the Kid Rock
Yes me the low key MC
With the ability to rock a party
Anywhere and make people stare
I'm lookin' while I'm cookin with no care
Pumpin the new sound town to town
Who holds it down like bad Leroy Brown
And still I won't stop growin' this flat top
The Genuine Article

They don't want me
'Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done

Everything I do gonna be funny

New Player on the field so yield and get back
To the wall
'Cause I'm playin' ya all
Like a game
K-I-D is the name
Some complain
And they got a little fame
And it's a shame
For what its worth
I'm down with earth
Pourin it on like Ms. Butterworth
Rich and thick
Kinda quick not slow
The rhymes I fit into flow
All in a row, from the intro
To the end so, ho
Put down the microphone and go
Step a side as I make room to bloom
Any opposing goo gets placed in a tomb
As soon as I grip the mic to get loose
Don't dispute 'cause ya got no juice
Meanwhile I kick a rhyme from the pile
Huh, As I Cramp your style (style... style)

Cramp your style (Cramp your style... cramp your style)

Get down on your knees and pray when I break you
Down with a sound
Comin' down with a pound
Or a bang
If you can't hang with the slang
That I exploit
Comin' straight from Detroit
Rough without a doubt or a question
Kid Rock here in the flesh
And addressin and defining certain issues
To diss you (he diss me... aheo)
So wipe the tears from your eyes
You can't hide so don't be surprised
When I dismiss you from your throne
And send you home
As a Kid Rock clone
'Cause I can hold my own
Like ya hold a milkbone
Simple as this with a grip that won't quit
So when I hit the skit
That's it
So don't come in face with the base
And remember your just an imitation
Don't get buckwhile
In fact don't smile
'Cause I'll pull your file
As I Cramp your style (style... style)

Cramp your style (cramp your style... cramp your style)
I'll claim the boundries of my domain
Detroit... Detroit
Fresh, I'm from the Midwest
From MoTown... From MoTown

I'm like steel or concrete yo 'cause I'm the hardest
Down with a label known to be the largest
Not bein modest don't even think of tryin' to hang
Cause yo Kid Rock rolls like a Stop O
I roll thick
I roll heavy
D-Nice justs keeps the pace steady
So get ready to feel the pain
I'm Kid Rock drivin' girls insane
So listen rappers and get to the program
Breakin ya down is the Kid rock slogan
And any rapper who thinks about dissin
You know what I'll say?
I got a great big dick
So anyone who can't adjust
Gets rust
And then bites the dust
Be ready to walk a mile
'Cause I'll smack that Kool-Aid smile
As I Cramp your style (style... style)
Cramp your style (cramp your style... cramp your style)

Burnin
Oh no, oh no, here we go now
Oh no, oh no, here we go now
Oh no, oh no, here we go now
Oh no...

Went to New York to cut my first LP
Ridin' down Broadway in a taxi
Hang a right at 25th
Just a little too swift, jo'
Let me out, I'm gonna walk from here on
Heres four bucks you drive like a moron
Lost in the apple and I'm all alone

Cause New York's Not My Home

In the village just illin with a forty in a brown bag
I'm seein freaks, and also fags
I see a set of nice legs within in my site
But it's a fuckin' transvestite
Walkin' in the daylight
Now I'm trippin' and I'm like blown
But I take another sip and say to each his own
He'd get dissed in Detroit, but I'll leave him alone

Cause New York's Not My Home

Now if your sounds are knockin' to the cool Kid Rockin'
Has got your girl jockin
Take a chill pill young man, close your flap
Cause like the Piston Joe, I'm goin' back to back
With a track, uh, that's just too clean
I got my pistol packed and a fifth of Jim Beam
Only 19, and my name ain't Wilbur
But I pull more hoes then Long Jon Silver
I don't dress up, or try to look pretty
Instead I rock the house in every major city
From the tip of Maine to the coast of Cali
I get down and I yodle in the valley
Can't say I'm from the Bronx or Brookland zones

Cause New Yorks Not My Home

Eigth ave in the 40 deuce, it's like a freak show
A lot of hookers try to pop that weak, so
I walk with a limp when I pimp through
Or co-mack those hoes if I'm illin with the Beast Crew
It's pickin' up, ill check this fact
These Mother Fuckers pay over 2.50 for a big mac
Conjested, overcrowded, cya I'm gone

Cause New York's Not My Home

Bonnie shades
And a high top fade
So low you know on the mic with no aid
You didn't think in a blink no way
That I'd make the grade
But now you say I use to go to school with him
I use to go to dot dot bim
I use to know his older brother
I use to be his eigth grade lover
Talk is cheap and the speech is weak
He use to go with me, wrong you were my freak
I never gave a hoot
If a girl was cute
All I wanted was a piece and a knock the boots
And then they get dissed
Crossed off my list
Though a bend in my behind would get kissed
Just like so world the girls will go low
Just like Jock Custoe
And blow
Up come my drawers, see ya gotta go
It's to plain
Kid Rock's the name
And I run my game
From Frisco to Maine
Never fell in love
'Cause I'm a girl heartbreaker
But still I built my skills and I'm the

'Cause I'm the

Stop the madness
You never had this
Wild style of my b-boy badness
Runnin' the show
Clockin the dough
And Juliet get fucked if I was Romeo, but I'm not
I'm Kid Rock
Flat top and all
Not Michael Jackson spinnin singing off the wall
But making everyone how I thump like thunder
Got over like a mother
While you went straight under
And now you can't stand
The way I jam
Hold the mic in my hand
And rock the whole land
Man get jealous if you want to
But either way I'm gonna do what I have to do
'Cause I work to hard to make ends match
Started from scrath
And to a lot of crap
But now I'm like a wild horse no one can catch
And I'm a bad mother fucker
Believe that
I'll pop on top more flop no stop
Makin' every girl in the house want a piece of the rock
And then I'll bring a new swing
To make it understand the kid's running things
Mostly because I'm not an MC faker
And the rest because I'm the

Never thought about the other side, oh no
It was always lets go try to pull some hoes
And I pulled 'em like a tow-truck
Since I was a young buck
Guaranteed the hoes always got fucked
With a one-two and all that good shit
I never flipped or tripped or got pussy whipped
'Cause I'm K-K-K-K Kid Rock motherfucker
You wanna piece of me
You're just another sucker
But oh well you don't bother me none
Cause me and your girl have lots of fun
You know the one that looks like a model
Sucks on my nuts like a baby on a milk bottle
Not 'cause I make her, I wouldn't make her
But 'cause I mack her right, she loves me all night

With a one-two and all that good shit
With a one-two I take another sip
With a one-two and I'll rock this party
With a one-two ya better ask somebody

Get down girl and read my mind
And you'll see that it's focused on your behind
You gotta lotta class and don't mind me askin
But can I go up in your fat ass
And just pump, pump, pump
What's next? check your money
It's scum and its time to jet
You bet she'll be into it more
On the bed the steps and the kitchen floor
You like the way the K-I-
Did it like I said I
Would, could, should I do it good
In your neighborhood
On your fuckin' block
'Cause I'm the coooool the Kid Rock
Kid Rock, Kid Kid Rock, Kid Kid Rock, Kid Rock, Kid Rock
Make it nasty

Hoes talk the same shit
Ya dress like a slob
But bitches still give a good blow-job
Up come my drawers and it's goodbye
The Kid Rock's just got to fly 'Cause it's 1-9-9-0
Time to fuck hoes
But before ya goin' put Jimmy in a lambskin
And we could bump all night you bet
So get set to jet and go get wet
Come on outta your girdle and slacks
And I'll shine that booty like turtle wax

With a one-two and all that good shit
With a one-two I take another sip
With a one-two and I'll rock this party
With a one-two ya better ask somebody
Bitch

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

[Voice Talking:] Yeah, but you know people are scared to have conversations
Like this and that's... and that's what it boils down to.
When you see a guy you already know whether not you want to fuck him,
Don't you?
[Girl:] Yep
[Voice Talking:] Guaranteed
[Girl:] Yep

All right we are gonna have a hot time in the old town tonight

See a fly skinny on the avenue
My shades down hat flipped on and on a cashew
Could not believe my eyes so I lifted up my shades
And this girl is starring at me as if she wanted to get laid
Next the girl started steppin and she crossed the street
She walked to me and at that my knees got weak
Then I snapped to realize that it was my duty
To get this freak and co-wax the booty

Wax that booty
Co-wax the booty
Freaky freaky freak with the nice size booty
Wax that booty
Co-wax the booty
I gotta freak freak so I am gonna wax her booty

Heading for the crib I was reciting some rhymes
When the freak cut in and started telling of the times
She wanted to rock me and these were no lies
And that is when I contracted the rise in my Levis
Step into my crib she said the rise impressed her
So without delay I began to undress her
Unstrapped her bra and whispered to her are you with me
She said yes so I grabbed them titties
Next was the test to see if she was high rank
I dropped her panties and was slippin, I asked do you stank
She said no and noted to me that her shower soap is Gucci
So I dropped my boxers and headed for her coochie
Headed fo her coochie
Grease it down real good
Headed for her coochie
Dang that's good

Now when I got to her coochie I looked close to see
If this girl had any types of signs of VD
She did not so I said to myself Oh goody
And I grabbed my dick and co-stuck in her puddy
Started rocking this freak with my hands on her butt
You should have seen in her booty I was tearin it up
Next I whispered in her ear baby please turn over
And rocked doggie style while I was calling her Rover
Still tearin it up on her face was a grin
Holdin' on to her waist pumping harder than sin
But she was lovin' it all with her back in a arch
I busted my nut and she started to bark
Arf... Arf... Arf
Uh
Arf... Arf... Arf
Uh
Arf... Arf... Arf
Na na bop but nop but

Now if you think the story is over just listen to this
I thought my mission was complete so I gave her a kiss
Then I was searchin for a towel to clean off my dickie
'Cause it was kinda wet all bloody and sticky
And to talk about gross heres something sicker than sick
The bitch dropped to her knees and licked the tip of my dick
I started trippin' cause this was something I've never seen
The girl was more than a freak she was a sexual fiend
And when I thought that was as gross as one girl could get
She stuck her finger in her booty and then she licked it
Oh now this girl was much more to me than a freak
In my opinion she was plain nasty
But never the less I completed my duty
I got this freak and co-waxed the booty

Wax that booty
Co-wax the booty
I got the freak and I waxed her booty
I love the booty, you love the booty
Hey freak come here and let me wax your booty

Too short don't stop
Too short don't stop
Too short don't stop the beat
Hey yo short dog can I get a bitch
Biiiiiiiitch

Now if you like the booty come on fellas show it
This is your last verse to wax so why would you blow it
And if the ladies if you are tired of a man on your fanny
Then fuck you go home and watch the tube with granny
Cause this is booty night non stop
With the number one wax and me Kid Rock
So let's get hyped 'cause if I see you calm
I am gonna think that you are waxin with Rosie Palm
I mean really how could you be so dumb
Just look at all the girls that are dying to get some
Man, just don't be a wussy
And I'll guarantee you could get a piece of pussy
But to get it you have to realize
Don't brag to the freak about your dick size
Man, that's not the way to win it
Cause it is not the length of your wand it's the magic in it

Wax that booty
Co-wax the booty
Freaky freaky freak with the nice size booty

Wax that booty
Co-wax the booty
I got freaks and I wax those booties

[Voice Talking:] Yeah, but you... you know... you know what I'm sayin'.
What kind of Popsicle you like?
[Girl:] What kind of Popsicle?
[Voice Talkng:] Yeah
[Girl:] Don't matter
[Voice Talkng:] Huh?
[Girl:] It don't matter
[Voice Talking:] It don't matter?
[Girl:] Nope
[Voice Talking:] So what, you gonna do that to mine, ain't you?
[Girl:] Nope
[Voice Talking:] Well you ought to.
I mean you ought to go run to the store
And you know they would never know what you practicing for.
They'll like, "Girl you trying to put some weighty not a Popsicle
And in the back of your mind no I'm practicing to suck Kid Rock's dick.
You know? That would be kind of sweet, wouldn't it?

All the girls want a Kid Rock poster
And be able to both stay looked at
The number one pimp with the number one rap
What's up with that
Well I'm a cool cat
With the rap
That's harder than a pimp slap
And because I do so much pimpin'
One day I'll probably walk with a limp
And drive a big Lincoln
Wearin an unbuttoned shirt
And be a fifty-five year old pervert
But for now rap's the occupation
But one day watch I'll be Pimp Of The Nation

But watch one day I'll be Pimp Of The Nation

Uh
Kick on back to the rap I format
When its through what you do is just play it back
Rewind it
Find it
That's how I desinged it
And fellas if you see a big butt get behind it
And grind on it
I mean push and bump
'Cause it's about time we made this party jump
Take a drink of your forty
And let's get naughty
Get on the floor and just move your body to the sound
I found and also developed
Lets trip don't sit, come on get the hell up
Look at the black man, now what'd up
He's not a skin head, that's the Abdul Jabar Cut

Yeah... Yeah
Streets of Romeo
Mt. Clemens
Detroit
All over

Now people always me and KDC
If we take this activity a seriously
I reply, with a sigh rather uniquely
And say does Donald Trump have a lotta money
Yes a stupid question, but I won't quote ya
'Cause I'm the Geraldo, Philmore, Oprah
I'm the K-I-D R-O-C-K
Down with Jive, RCA
Hey how could you judge me 'cause what I am
Be blind to my mind
And take a look and say fuck him
Look at the black man, now what up
He's not a skin head, that's the Abdul Jabar Cut

Okay... Yeah
Like I said
Top Dog
One, two, to the three
And we always come back for more

Kenny wears a low fade
Danny wears no fade
I wear the high fade
And we all get paid
Tryin' to blow my rap down the sink
But go ahead cause my rap's made of brick
And it sticks
Kicks
Hits
And uplifts
At shows, it flows but never drifts
It's too swift and moves with quickness
Top Dog again and you say what is this
It's the under rated MC on top
The young six foot one Kid Rock
Look at the black man, now what's up
He's not a skin head, that's the Abdul Jabar Cut

Okay... Yeah
Get down
Come back
The black man from New Jersey

I think you might like to hear something from us

Stand up
Put your hands up
Come on get up
Kid Rock's in the house yo, Ready to pick up
The tempo and you know in so I will fo somewhat unconventional
But comprehendible
I'm the presentable the good lookin'
The Mello Yellow young fellow and I'm cookin
Heatin the house up just like a hot plate
Smooth on the groove like an ice skate
You didn't think in a blink I'd stand here
But now you're in fear and stand clear
You can't come near this hot stylin
Groove by the kid who's smooth as a violin
Also the perfect lyric announcer
On the set with a cold forty ouncer
Ready to glide from side to side
Why, 'cause I Step In Stride

These are the criteria I believe should be applied
'Cause I step in stride
These are the criteria I believe should be applied

N-N-Now yes I'm new
But before I'm through
Your gonna see I paddle my own canoe
'Cause I'm solo
A young pro on the go
Close to an angel
But I wear no Halo
I just shake, create, and never act fake
And I learned to dislike and not hate
Because hatred leads to an uproar
Violence is one thing I am not here for
I'm just here flat out and to blow the roof
Kick some watts and that's what I inted to do
Pump it up like an air comb presser
Teach to each like a wise professor
No job I strive to reach high
Make the girls in the house all sigh
And I'll glide from side to side
Why, 'cause I Step in Stride

These are the criteria I believe should be applied
I step in stride
These are the criteria I believe should be applied

Applied, Step in Stride you bet I do
Get you high like a bottle of German Brew
Comin' clean
New on the scene
Makin' girls scream if you know what I mean
'Cause they dream of me to rock the place
And put a big smile upon their face
Any girl of any race
But they have to like the b-b-bass
And that's the rep I've earned and kept on the set
Workin up a sweat
No Jive Kid Rock uparrivd
And I Step in Stride

These are the criteria I believe should be applied
I step in stride
These are the criteria I believe should be applied
Thee... Thee... Thee... Thee
These are the criteria
Thee... Thee... Thee... Thee
These are the criteria I believe should be applied Applied... applied... applied... applied
Applied... plied... plied... plied

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

White boy get ready to do his thing's here
Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh

Here's a new jam for you to cling to
A funky rhythm that you can swing to
Kid Rock that's me
And the party jumpin' is what I'm for seeing
So just chill or I'll boot you
Get on me and I'll shoot you
I'm fresh to that there's no guessin
Rock the mic without any fessin
With your blessin
I will get stupid, you didn't know it
I thought you knew it
I'm the kid that comes exactin
With my ace the black man
To B Boys from the Midwest
Rock the shows cause were professionals
On the set night and day while the girls say

Upside Down
Can't you turn me inside out
And round and round
Upside Down
Can't you turn me inside out
And round and round

The bass drops and works its hardest
For Kid Rock the new young rap artist
Clockin paper 'cause I got soul
Comin' at you from the Motor capital
Shakin booties
Not all the cuties
I'm too cool to be a little fruity
Drinkin' forties every weekend
I'm the master who's always speakin'
To some freak and if I freak her
It's at Red Roof Inn where we sleep cheaper
But off that topic got to get it
Super dope, extremely poetic
The K-I-D-R-O-C-Kin
I love girls that's how its layin
With these jammies
Fuck the grammies
All I care about is shaking fannies
And I have been doin' it for a long time
But now I'm nineteen
And in my prime
Waxin booties everyday while the girls say

Upside Down
Can't you turn me inside out
And round and round
Upside Down
Can't you turn me inside out
And round and round

On the mic is solo
'Cause I'm the Kid with all the dope lingos
Only rappin' 'cause I don't sing dope
Create a jam that's fresh in your bingo
Lace up the Reebox
Comb the high top
Black dose with a little hip hop
And I style it with some uniqueness
You say I'm not fresh
But I could careless
One of a kind
When I rock the mic
And I'm the one that your girl is likin
Picture the girless women not lookin'
Create a beat that is fully hookin
'Cause when I get dumb
People have fun
Sisco save me the magnum
In a hell of a show I always display
While the girls say
Upside Down
Can't you turn me inside out
And round and round
Upside Down
Can't you turn me inside out
And round and round

Ooh... oh
Upside Kid Rock, Kid Rock
He's on the upside
Get down Kid Rock
He's on the upside
Get down Kid Rock
On the Upside
Upsideeeeeeeee
Upside get down Kid Rock
Your on the Upside
Get down Kid Rock
Your on the Upside
Get down Kid Rock
Your on the Upside
Upside
Kid Rock
Kid Rock
Kid Rock
Kid Rock

Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh
Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh
Uh, Kid Rock

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Non-commercial lyrics run like Hershel
Walkin' fast 'cause I'm a smooth talker
Appeal the feel, but don't praise and kneel
Just heal
And always look for the seal that's real
Top Dog, lookin' up to say what is this
Kid Rock serious and I mean business
Ascending up and up I keep boosting
Makin' hit records like Whitney Houston
With a mind of violence, right, I might
Blow the show teachers speakin' yo, I cut MP's
To release to each and be friends of
Every single, individual

Everybody all over the world, it's time for understandin
Come together

Jumbo, yo that's how I'm movin
I'm the new kid in, here's what I'm givin'
A jammed, slammin', command that take authority
Cause too many MC's appear apsrt of me
Name and they claim me, yo, that they're winnin'
A lotta just came in, sound the same in
Thinkin' they swift and can get with these young men
But I keep the crowd swingin' like Tarzan
'Cause I'm a wise man here to teach and speak
And if you step out of line your up shits creek
So come with it, Kid Rock's gonna get it
His style ain't dope, it's a throat, and I slit it
I'm raw like cowhide, smooth like a plane ride
No half steppin, I always take a full stride
Who came played and they say I'm concrete made
I used to come correct in the projects
New Port, Oxford, deep in the basement
House and parties like real estate agent
So on, so strong, and everyone got along
Knowledge is power, and there's a point to this song

Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin
Come together
Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin
Come together

Now as I said my prayers through the years I shed a few tears
'Cause it's unjust when I see my peers get shot
And dropped and forgot, now that's hot
Too many can't score as victims of a drug war
Cocaines ran and weapons are shipped out
The press finds out, then the public is tripped out
New tax the acts and half the drug industry
Uncle Sam is my man, are you kiddin me
Me in the Whitehouse, now that's fucked up
For one to get over, one must get stuck up
One will roll up, another will smoke up
Two more thrown in jail, who picks the toll up
Tell her to beware if she's gonna stand there
Eyes bugged out and hands in the air
Cause there comes an onlooker, lookin' for a hooker
And act like the doors overlooked her and took her
For a place to hide and when he got his ride
He let the nice slide and the girl, she died
Her family cried over this homicide
And why they pondered, why she wandered
Left her own spot, her home, her mom and pop
All to smoke a little cooked up rock
So on and so strong, she couldn't get along
Knowledge is power, and there's a point to this song

Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin
Come together
Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin
Come together

From the outskirts with a mind like Albert Einstein
Maybe I'm ahead of my time
Imaginate, create, spectate, elevate from the states
Surrounded by the Great Lakes
I was once out cold at 15 years old
Rolled and sold, you, me, and Bo
Sittin' in Jackson infested with rats
With a silver gat tucked deep in my slacks
I was a young bad mother in my own eyes
But now I realize it wasn't too wise
So now I teach, I'll reach to each
And every single individual

Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin
Come together
Come together
Come together
Come... come... come... come together

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

People like the way my style is rollin'
The crowd rebounds as I flow slowin
I'm not bullshittin
Heres how I'm hittin
Funkin it up more than George Clinton
Swingin', and bringin' in a new format
A new breed indeed and I'm sure of that
I'll impress the best, I won't rest the best
'Cause I'm blessed and I just won't settle for less
Yes the kid who gets the crowd up
The one with the hair that stands straight up
People look and stare in shock

Trippin' over a Rock
Trippin' over a Rock

Chased and chased and chased, but never close to caught
And the skills I filled were all self taught
With so many styles on each panfulls
And they hit ya like a fifth a jack daniels
As the girls admire the way I aspire
To move higher and build my own empire
Not a liar, I tell no lies
So hey girl you can trust these blue eyes
But don't get me wrong I get wicked
Shake that ass in my face and I'll stick it
Hit it, get wit it
Knock it out the box

Trippin' over a rock
Trippin' over a rock

A genuine badman
Like Yosemite Sam man
I c-c-c-can rock the land
And bring a new swing and sensation
To represent the next generation
So slack up, you better back up
Come the score and you leave in a jigsaw
Fuck with me
With no doubt
I'll put my foot in your ass and won't pull it out
I'll go deep in I won't weaken
Guarenteed to keep the house leapin
Girls flockin guys
Try to to cockblock

Cause everybody's Trippin' Over A Rock

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I had a realization of God, I saw God And umm,
Its not a face or a figure or anything It was a presence,
Umm the woods (all natural) God is all natural The sun,
The universe, everything You, me were part of God,
Were part of God It was an incredible feeling
And to use acid is religious for me

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Kid rock that's right you know I'm back ho
From the dead where I had to lay low
Seems strange but I ain't changed nothing
Pot smokin' beer drinkin' mother fucker that's me
In the flesh and I guess I'm the best
In the muther fuckin' midwest 'cause there's no contest
For the pimp in the pimp of the nation
So fuck college and a good education
All we need to learn is how to hold hands
Then we could live in peace in my homeland
God damn the way my pain swells
I spend all my time killin' brain cells
The light shed on me was a dim gleam
So I live life in a bottle of Jim Beam
Droppin' dots or sniffin' that blow black,
I go to sleep at night watchin' Kojak
Fuck hoes 'cause I'm no big fag
Roll with Zig Zags like to read skin mags
When I shoot I never miss
And if I played the bass I'd probably pluck it like this...
People wanna know what I'm thinkin' but I don't care
So I keep my thoughts in a bottle of Cuervo
Just a wild young buck
Got banned from the shelter but I really don't give a fuck
'Cause I still be clownin' suckers be frownin'
Forties of Busch I be poundin'
I ain't dead in the head like Manson
I'm more laid back than muther fuckin' Ted Danson
Hanson brother style when I'm rumblin'
Couple of shots of Don Q and I be stumblin'
Fumblin' footballs hangin' in the pool halls
Out late night with my crew stealin' U-hauls
I'm not into havin' clean fun
I step into the party strapped with a machine gun
But I'm no gangster like Gotti
"I'm just an M.C. to put the boogie in the party"
Back in black plus a new track
And I won't quit till your ears blow from feedback
When I shoot I never miss
And if I played the guitar I'd probably strum it like this...
So give it up bitch 'cause I'm the kid rock
And today I know you don't wanna get shot
You look gay you're too cliche
So fuck all y'all hoes and yo Chuck pass the jay
Sellin' me out like bitches to make a quick buck
But muther fuckers like y'all just have no luck
Your little plan was a flop
Tryin' to get 'em on by sellin out the Kid Rock
A part of me was with you but yo he died,
And I'm glad you stepped off 'cause I ain't givin' no free rides
You little bald headed peon
And fuck it mother fucker if you want it let's get the beef on
'Cause I'm sure I'm sure ya
Are gonna try to come back around but I'll ignore ya
It only takes one shot to floor ya
'Cause I'm Kid Rock bitch and I'm real mutha for ya
Better jet so 'cause I won't let no hoes from the metro
Take mine "what up doe"
Come look son I'm number one...
"'Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done"
In the twilight zone with Rod Serling
I ain't goin' bald so fuck Sy Sperling
When I shoot I never miss
And if I played the harmonica I'd probably blow it like this...

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

'Cause growin' up I was never
The logical one
Packed my shit and left home
Like the prodigal son
With a bottle of jack
And my shotgun strapped
I went looking for fame
And yo I've never been back

Filled with spite
Staying high as a kite
I was dealing and stealing
Everything in sight
Pool hustling
Trying to make that green
I've been ramblin and gamblin
Since the age of 13

Working like a bitch
Like a god damn tank
Some disagree because
My rents had bank
But all that's gold
Don't always glitter
So I'll take another puff
From my one hitter

I'm a slave to the trade
I'm paid to rhyme
Blow all my cash
On cheap women and wine
'Cause money, money, money
Ain't shit to me
But I gotta make a lot
Just to be free

I'm here and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock, bitch and I'm everywhere
I'm here and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock, ho and I'm everywhere

Many nights she comes to me and fills me where I lay
I hope to god one day she gonna see that love is not that way
She holds in that morning time and never lets me go
I hold on back one day she gonna see and come into my show

Please God please
I'll pay any cost
If you'd just stop the world
'Cause I wanna get off
There's too much hardship
There's too much pain
There's too many motherfuckers
Tryin' to get in my brain

I've been to your mountains
I've been to your seaside
And everywhere I went
Somebody's wanted a free ride
But parasites can't fake the Rock
And any suckers that step in my way are getting shot

'Cause I hold key
To my own success
And suckers that step
Shall be put to rest
I hold the key
To my own success
And suckers that step
Will catch a bullet in their chest

So pass the buddha
The funky tie hooter
And watch me rip
Because I'm such a slick shooter
Not a generic dime-
A-dozen M.C.
Never was in a posse
Never wanted to be

I'm here and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock, bitch and I'm everywhere
I'm here and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock, ho and I'm everywhere

Many nights she comes to me and fills me where I lay
I hope to god one day she gonna see that love is not that way
She holds in that morning time and never lets me go
I hold on back one day she gonna see and come into my show

Now I've been walking the earth
Since the beginning of time
And won't leave till
I've received that 7th sign
All this talk
Their gonna drop the bomb
But life keeps going
On and on and on and on

The world's end
Don't worry me
And I'm gonna get where I'm going
Just don't hurry me
'Cause I'm in no rush
And I can't stand rushin
Everything is slow motion
Like I'm trippin' on tussin'

Fussin with the girls
They waste my time
Thrashin and bashin
Going out of my mind
Crucified by the critics
Everyday
'Cause I really ain't got
That much to say

I'm a slave to the trade
I'm paid to rhyme
I don't wear a watch
And I don't keep time
I live my life
Just like the skipper
But only at night
Because I'm a day tripper

Twitchin, shakin
And I get more bass
Then John Paul Jones
Visions of red shoot through my head
And I won't stop trippin'
Till the day I'm dead

I'm here and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock bitch and I'm everywhere
I'm here and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock hoe and I'm everywhere

Many nights she comes to me and fills me where I lay
I hope to god one day she gonna see that love is not that way
She holds in that morning time and never lets me go
I hold on back one day she gonna see and come into my show

Yeah... Yeah... Yeah on down
Hey... hey, hey... hey, hey, hey, hey
On down, on down, on down, down, down, down, down
Well, well, well, well
Hey heeeeeeeeeey
Yeah your fuckin' with the Kid Rock honey
Get back on the streets and get my money
Money, money, money, money, money, money
Get my money
Yeah you fuckin' with the Kid Rock baby
You can have my car if it will drive you crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy

Yeah your fuckin' with the Kid Rock honey
Get back on the streets and get my money
Yeah you fuckin' with the Kid Rock baby
You can have my car if it will drive you crazy
